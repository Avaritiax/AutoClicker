pip install -r requirements.txt

The provided code is a Python script for recording and replaying mouse actions. It uses the keyboard library to start and stop the recording process and the pynput.mouse library to capture mouse events such as clicks, scroll movements, and mouse position.

When executed, the script allows you to start the recording by pressing the 'q' key and stop it by pressing the 'e' key. The recorded mouse actions are saved to a file called "recorded_actions.txt". The script also includes a function to load and replay the recorded actions.

To use the script, you can follow these steps:

Press 'q' to start recording.
Perform mouse actions such as clicks, scrolls, and movements.
Press 'e' to stop recording and save the actions to "recorded_actions.txt".
Run the script again to replay the recorded actions from the file.
